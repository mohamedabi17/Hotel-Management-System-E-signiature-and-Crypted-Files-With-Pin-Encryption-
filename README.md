"#Invoice Generation and Electronic Signature with Encryption
This file explains how invoices are generated, electronic signatures are added for security, and the resulting PDFs are encrypted using a user-provided PIN code in the PHP script."

Dependencies:

PHP (tested with version 7.4 or later)
Composer for package management
FPDI library (https://github.com/topics/fpdi) for PDF manipulation
FPDI Protection library ([invalid URL removed]) for PDF encryption
Installation:

Install Composer: https://getcomposer.org/

Open a terminal in your project directory and run:

Bash
composer require setasign/fpdi setasign/fpdi-protection
Use code with caution.

Script Breakdown:

db.php (not provided): This file likely contains the database connection details and functions for interacting with your database.
generate_invoice.php: This script handles invoice generation, electronic signature creation, and PDF encryption.
Key Functions:

generateInvoice($bookingDetails, $signaturePath, $pinCode):

Creates a new PDF using FPDI Protection.
Adds invoice header and booking details sections with formatting.
Generates an electronic signature image based on the provided text ($signatureText).
Calculates a unique string from booking details and PIN code.
Hashes the unique string using MD5 (consider using a more secure hashing algorithm like SHA-256).
Uses the hash to randomize font size, angle, and position for a more dynamic signature appearance.
Inserts the electronic signature image at the bottom.
Saves the PDF to a file with a unique name based on the customer ID.
Calls encryptPDF to encrypt the generated PDF.
Returns the path to the encrypted invoice file.
encryptPDF($filePath, $pinCode):

Creates a new FPDI Protection instance.
Imports all pages from the provided PDF ($filePath).
Creates new pages and copies content from imported pages.
Sets PDF encryption permissions (print, copy) requiring the user-provided PIN code for access.
Saves the encrypted PDF to the same file path.
generateSignature($signatureText, $filePath, $pinCode, $bookingDetails) (revised):

Creates a signature image with dynamic font size, angle, and position based on a hash of the combined booking details and PIN code.
Saves the signature image to the specified path ($filePath).
Usage:

The script is likely triggered when a user submits a booking form.
The form data (room details, customer information, etc.) is used to populate the $bookingDetails array.
A user-provided PIN code is likely used in the $pinCode variable.
The script generates the invoice, electronic signature, encrypts the PDF, and sends a success response with the invoice file path.
Security Considerations:

Database Security: The provided code snippet doesn't include database interaction. However, ensure proper database security practices are followed, such as using prepared statements to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
PIN Code Strength: Encourage users to choose strong PIN codes that are not easily guessable.
Server-Side Processing: Process all booking and invoice generation logic on the server-side to prevent potential client-side manipulation.
Additional Notes:

This example uses MD5 for hashing, which is considered less secure than newer algorithms like SHA-256. Consider updating the hashing function if desired.
The code might require adjustments depending on your specific database structure and form submission process.
Error handling and logging are essential for robust functionality.
Conclusion:

This solution demonstrates a basic implementation of invoice generation with electronic signatures and user-provided PIN code encryption. Enhance security by following the additional recommendations and tailoring the script to your specific application requirements.
